**Twitter-Sentiment_analysis**
  So, here i have created a twitter sentiment analysis app using **django**,
 
I have done this with the help of **textblob** and **tweepy** Packages

The concept is,
  -> You just need to enter a search query
  -> So, this app searches for tweets from that query and sorts out as negative/positive/neutral tweet
  
 If you need to run this in your machine,
  ->Install tweepy and textblob using pip installer(Provided you have python 3.8 and above versions)
  ->Secondarily install django 
  ->Finally runserver from django manage.py
  ->There you can enjoy using my app :)
